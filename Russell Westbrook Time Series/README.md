Research Assignment
---------------------
In 2016-2017, Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder had a historic year. In addition to winning the MVP award and scoring title, 
he averaged a triple double. He became just the second player in history to average a triple double (the last time was in 1962) over a 
whole season.

This is an analysis of Westbrook's points per game (PPG). 


Goals
